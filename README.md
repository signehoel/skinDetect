# skinDetect

Welcome! This project focuses on using machine learning to allow users to assess their risk of potentially having skin cancer. In the middle of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, this tool is especially important as people are trying to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor.

## Installation

In order to use my project, you can simply go to the following link: https://signehoel.github.io/skinDetect/ 

However, if you would like to use it locally, clone this repository and run it on a local server. 

## Usage

The usability of my project is simple enough - the steps are even written on the web page (index.html). In order to receive predictions from the model, you can click the 'select file' option and upload a clear, upclose picture of a skin lesion that you would like diagnosed. It is preferable that it is a square image (as the model was trained with square photos), but the program will automatically resize it for you if not.
